    lyrics: `    I'm still a fan even though I was salty
    Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
    Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one driving
    I'm so mature, I'm so mature
    I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
    I don't want none, I just want you
    If I can't have you, no one should
    I might
    I might kill my ex, not the best idea
    His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
    I might kill my ex, I still love him though
    Rather be in jail than alone
    I get the sense that it's a lost cause
    I get the sense that you might really love her
    The text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
    I tried to ration with you, no murders, no crimes of passion, but damn
    You was out of reach
    You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
    Now I'm in amazement, playing on my patience
    Now you laying face-down, got me singing over a beat
    I'm so mature, I'm so mature
    I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
    I don't want none, I just want you
    If I can't have you, no one will
    (I might)
    I might kill my ex, not the best idea
    His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
    I might kill my ex, I still love him though
    Rather be in jail than alone
    I did it all for love (love)
    I did it all on no drugs (drugs)
    I did all of this sober
    I did it all for us, oh
    I did it all for love (love)
    I did it all of this on no drugs (drugs)
    I did all of this sober
    Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'll kill your ass tonight)
    Uh, I just killed my ex (my ex)
    Not the best idea (idea)
    Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here?
    I just killed my ex (my ex)
    I still love him, though (I do)
    Rather be in Hell than alone`,

    lyrics: `He is sensible and so incredible
    And all my single friends are jealous
    He says everything I need to hear, and it's like
    I couldn't ask for anything better
    He opens up my door and I get into his car
    And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
    And I feel perfectly fine
    But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
    And it's 2 a.m. and I'm cursing your name
    So in love that you act insane
    And that's the way I loved you
    Breaking down and coming undone
    It's a roller coaster kind of rush
    And I never knew I could feel that much
    And that's the way I loved you
    He respects my space
    And never makes me wait
    And he calls exactly when he says he will
    He's close to my mother
    Talks business with my father
    He's charming and endearing
    And I'm comfortable
    But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
    And It's 2 a.m. and I'm cursing your name
    You're so in love that you act insane
    And that's the way I loved you
    Breaking down and coming undone
    It's a roller coaster kind of rush
    And I never knew I could feel that much
    And that's the way I loved you
    He can't see the smile I'm faking
    And my heart's not breaking
    'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
    And you were wild and crazy
    Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated
    Got away by some mistake and now
    I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
    It's 2 a.m. and I'm cursing your name
    I'm so in love that I acted insane
    And that's the way I loved you
    Breaking down and coming undone
    It's a roller coaster kind of rush
    And I never knew I could feel that much
    And that's the way I loved you
    Whoa-whoa-oh-oh, oh
    And that's the way I loved you
    Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
    Never knew I could feel that much
    And that's the way I loved you`

    lyrics: `I know a place
    It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face
    We get married in our heads
    Something to do while we try to recall how we met
    Do you think I have forgotten?
    Do you think I have forgotten?
    Do you think I have forgotten
    About you?
    You and I (don't let go) were alive (don't let go)
    With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes
    Wait (don't let go) and pretend (don't let go)
    Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end
    Do you think I have forgotten?
    Do you think I have forgotten?
    Do you think I have forgotten
    About you?
    Do you think I have forgotten?
    Do you think I have forgotten?
    Do you think I have forgotten
    About you?
    There was something 'bout you that now I can't remember
    It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender
    And I miss you on a train, I miss you in the morning
    I never know what to think about
    I think about you (so don't let go)
    About you (so don't let go)
    Do you think I have forgotten
    About you? (Don't let go)
    About you
    About you
    Do you think I have forgotten
